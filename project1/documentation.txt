Is the goal of the script clear? (+5)

The goal of the script is something similar to Lab 6. When running the script, the usere will view a page with a link to another page.
The link to the other page will then redirect the user to a new page to see the output of the script. The script's output wil just say something like "hi, welcome to my project 1".

Is the documentation on how to run the script clear? (+5)

How to run the script: 
1. Open powershell and change into the project 1 folder. For me, it was something like: 

PS C:\Users\Administrator\it3038c-scripts\project1>

2. Once im in this location, open vscode and create a few files:

    - file named project1.js
    - a folder named Public
        -inside that folder a file named index.html
3. after putting appropiate code within the two files i am going to save both files. 
4. Back in powershell, run command "npm install ip"
5. then run command "node project1.js"
6. open a browser of your liking then go to "http://localhost:3000/" and you should see your results.
